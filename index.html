        JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]] offers a JSON-based serialization for Linked Data.
        One of the primary uses of JSON-LD is its ability for RDF exchange across the Web.
        This can be done by first <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">serializing RDF to JSON-LD</a>,
        after which others can <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">deserializing JSON-LD to RDF</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since RDF datasets may contain many triples,
        and JSON-LD documents don't have size limits,
        such documents could become very large.
        For these cases, the ability to serialize and parse JSON-LD in a <em>streaming</em> way offers many advantages,
        as large documents can be parsed with only a limited amount of memory,
        and processed chunks can be emitted as soon as they are processed,
        as opposed to waiting until the whole dataset or document has been processed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/">recommended processing algorithms</a>
        do not work in a streaming manner, as these first load all required data in memory,
        after which this data can be processed.
        This note discusses the processing of JSON-LD in a streaming way.
        Concretely, a set of guidelines is introduced for efficiently serializing and deserializing of JSON-LD in a streaming way.
        These guidelines are encapsulated in a JSON-LD streaming profile,
        so that implementations can detect JSON-LD documents that conform to this profile, and may apply streaming optimizations.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          This document discusses the concerns on serializing and deserializing JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          This document is primarily intended for the following audiences:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Software developers who want to implement the streaming algorithms to serialize or deserialize JSON-LD documents.
          </li>
          <li>
              Web authors and developers who want to publish JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          </li>
          <li>
              Web authors and developers who want to consume JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          To understand the basics in this note you must first be familiar with
          <a data-cite="RFC8259" data-no-xref="">JSON</a>, which is detailed in [[RFC8259]]. You must also understand the
          JSON-LD syntax defined in the <a data-cite="JSON-LD11" data-no-xref="">JSON-LD 1.1 Syntax specification</a> [[JSON-LD11]],
          which is the base syntax used for streaming processing.
          To understand how JSON-LD maps to RDF, it is helpful to be
          familiar with the basic RDF concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
